# Hi, I'm Nora ðŸ‘‹

I help organizations harness the power of AI â€” just like electricity transformed factories during the industrial era, AI is reshaping industries today.  
I'm passionate about applying AI in real-world systems, from oil & gas, healthcare, and finance, to marketing, business operations, and human biosignals.  
My work often bridges AI with hardware, including Raspberry Pi and embedded systems, driving innovation from algorithms to real-world impact.
